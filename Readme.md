@Raymond Loman

Done:

- `` Use Mustache for front-end styling_ ``
- `` Quantity of aiports can be changed_ ``



To do:

- Fixed list of airports including Amsterdam, Berlin, Stockholm, London and Paris. If a user wants to fly a plane to a new airport, a new airport needs to be created first.
- Unit testing with the use of Mockito.
- Proper front-end styling and UI
- Method to deduct 200.000 fuel when a plane has been transferred to a new airport (excluding existing airport).
